# Nippon Data Scrapping

A Python-based project for scraping data from Nippon sources and storing it in an Excel file. The project is aimed at automating the process of data extraction and storage. 
In this project I have used VBA code to invoke the python code. 
For the succesful execution of the code the end user should have python, any IDE, and all the related packages used in this project installed in his/her system. 

## Features
- Automated data scraping from Nippon sources.
